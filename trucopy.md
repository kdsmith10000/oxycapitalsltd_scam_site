## CRITICAL: Exchange Source Wallets (KYC Evidence)

All funds into the SOL scam wallet came from KYC-verified exchanges:

1. **04:11:44 UTC** - INCOMING from **Kraken Hot Wallet**
   - Address: FWznbcNXWQuHTawe9RxvQ2LdCENssh12dsznf4RiouN5
   - Amount: 18.78 SOL ($3,908.10)

2. **04:17:09 UTC** - OUTGOING to cash-out wallet
   - Address: 7Ab4npbSR7cTi1gKBW6EiUHco5L5HrsCVDRns8j2DiFQ
   - Amount: 0.048 SOL ($9.99)

### Law Enforcement Action Items
1. **Subpoena Kraken** for withdrawal records to Cgrr9RgazhDtigGSu3GAYDbCUV3b1KqPPmuhuUqaoxWJ on Sep 04, 2025 04:11:44 UTC
2. **Subpoena Coinbase** for withdrawal records to Cgrr9RgazhDtigGSu3GAYDbCUV3b1KqPPmuhuUqaoxWJ on Sep 04, 2025 04:32:29 UTC
3. Cross-reference KYC records between both exchanges

## Total Documented Losses: $30,869.90

## Victim Analysis

### Estimated Victim Count: 2-4 unique victims

| Chain | Unique Depositing Wallets | Total Value Lost |
|-------|--------------------------|------------------|
| BTC | 1 (same wallet, 2 deposits) | ~$25,028 |
| SOL | 2 (exchange hot wallets) | ~$5,833 |
| ETH | 1 | ~$5 |
| **Total** | **3-4** | **~$30,866** |

**Key observations:**
- The BTC victim made 2 deposits from the same wallet (6 days apart) — classic "reload" scam tactic
- SOL deposits came through Coinbase and Kraken hot wallets (could be 1-2 victims)
- ETH deposit was minimal (~$5), possibly a test transaction

---

## Additional Forensic Evidence for Law Enforcement

### 1. Cash-Out Velocity Pattern — Proves Active Monitoring

| Transaction | Deposit Time | Cash-Out Time | Velocity |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| SOL #1 (Kraken) | 04:11:44 UTC | 04:17:09 UTC | **5 minutes 25 seconds** |
| SOL #2 (Coinbase) | 04:32:29 UTC | 08:15:43 UTC | **3 hours 43 minutes** |
| ETH | 21:38:35 UTC | 22:00:23 UTC | **22 minutes** |
| BTC #1 | 14:56:18 UTC | 16:14:58 UTC | **1 hour 18 minutes** |

**Evidence value:** The 5-minute SOL cash-out proves **real-time wallet monitoring**. Scammer was actively online and ready.

### 2. Single SOL Consolidation Wallet

All 3 SOL outbound transactions went to the **same destination**:
```
7Ab4npbSR7cTi1gKBW6EiUHco5L5HrsCVDRns8j2DiFQ
```
**Evidence value:** Proves **single operator** or organization.

### 3. BTC Victim Pattern — Same Source, Multiple Deposits

Both BTC deposits came from the **identical wallet**:
```
bc1qsatlphjcgvzlt9xhsgn0dnjus5jgwg83dr05c6
```

| Date | Amount | USD Value |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Jan 27, 2026 | 0.28364 BTC | $20,659 |
| Feb 02, 2026 | 0.05999 BTC | $4,369 |

**Evidence value:** Single victim convinced to send twice — "reload" scam tactic. Victim's wallet can be traced for testimony.

### 4. DEX Swap Laundering (ETH)

ETH moved via **"On Chain Swap"** to the ETH Swap Destination wallet listed above.

**Evidence value:** More sophisticated than direct transfer — indicates awareness of chain analysis tools.

### 5. Discord Account Metadata

| Attribute | Fake Account | Real Account |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Username | `_salma_ogs` | `salmaogs` |
| Member Since | **Jul 20, 2025** | Jun 12, 2020 |
| Mutual Servers | 0 | 1 |
| Account Age | ~6 months | ~5.5 years |

**Evidence value:** 
- Discord account creation (Jul 2025) provides **timestamp for operation start**
- Discord can be subpoenaed for IP addresses, email, payment methods, session logs

### 6. Cross-Scam Pattern — Possible Same Operator

TruCopy shares identical methodology with MirrorExp and OxyCapitals:

| Pattern | TruCopy | MirrorExp | OxyCapitals |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Discord impersonation | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Fake trading platform | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Multi-chain wallets | 8 chains | 4 chains | 3 chains |
| Rapid cash-out (<24h) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Combined losses across all three scams: $114,000+**

### 7. Operational Timeline

```
Jul 20, 2025 — Fake Discord account "_salma_ogs" created
Sep 04, 2025 — SOL deposits and cash-out (earliest blockchain activity)
Jan 27, 2026 — First BTC deposit from victim
Feb 02, 2026 — Second BTC deposit (same victim, "reload")
Feb 04, 2026 — ETH deposit and immediate DEX swap
```

## Subpoena Priority List

| Priority | Target | Data Available |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | **Discord** | IP logs, email, payment info for `_salma_ogs` account created Jul 20, 2025 |
| 2 | **Kraken** | KYC for withdrawal to `Cgrr9RgazhDtigGSu3GAYDbCUV3b1KqPPmuhuUqaoxWJ` on Sep 04, 2025 04:11:44 UTC |
| 3 | **Coinbase** | KYC for withdrawal to `Cgrr9RgazhDtigGSu3GAYDbCUV3b1KqPPmuhuUqaoxWJ` on Sep 04, 2025 04:32:29 UTC |
| 4 | **Exchange holding `7Ab4npbSR7cTi1gKBW6EiUHco5L5HrsCVDRns8j2DiFQ`** | SOL cash-out wallet KYC |
| 5 | **Exchange holding `bc1qdqqsq6y7csd0cr3ye45h9lv8ydh777j2wehgl6`** | BTC cash-out wallet KYC ($20.6K) |
| 6 | **Exchange holding `bc1q3lum3k6q738f3ct76zg47gshz8rn8ggph6smk3`** | BTC cash-out wallet KYC ($4.3K) |

---

## Summary: Strongest Evidence Points

1. **Discord account creation timestamp** — Jul 20, 2025 proves premeditation
2. **5-minute cash-out velocity** — proves real-time monitoring/coordination
3. **Single SOL destination wallet** — proves single operator
4. **Same BTC victim, two deposits** — proves "reload" scam technique
5. **Cross-scam pattern match** — may link to larger criminal network ($114K+ combined thefts)
